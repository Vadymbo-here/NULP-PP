## Getting Started

Welcome to the this COMPLEX WORK
IT'S a one complete task with 4 mini-taskes and with rules which have to be accounted.
So you should see a final program a this directory, hopefully.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `banking`: the packedge for Bank-depended classes/.java
- `commands`: a packedge for general *command* and other helpful commands as well as two more packages.
- `BankCommands`: a package for all Bank related commands.
- `UserCommands`: a package for all User related commands.
- `userclass`: small package only for a `User.java` class.
- `utils`: util for a project like single instanse class for Scanner, etc.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
